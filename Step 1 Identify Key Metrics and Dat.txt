Step 1: Identify Key Metrics and Data Sources

In Kubernetes, data can be collected from multiple sources. The most useful metrics for predicting issues include:

âœ… Node Metrics:

    CPU Usage, Memory Usage
    Disk I/O, Network Traffic
    Node Status (e.g., Ready, NotReady)

âœ… Pod Metrics:

    Pod Status (e.g., Running, CrashLoopBackOff)
    Container Restarts
    Resource Limits and Requests

âœ… Cluster Events:

    Failed Deployments
    Node Failures
    Scheduling Issues

âœ… Logs:

    Error logs from pods or services
    Kubernetes system logs (e.g., kubelet, kube-apiserver)

Step 2: Tools for Data Collection

You can use the following tools to gather these metrics:

ðŸ”¹ Prometheus â€“ For real-time metrics collection and monitoring
ðŸ”¹ Grafana â€“ For visualizing the collected data
ðŸ”¹ Elasticsearch â€“ For storing and querying logs efficiently
ðŸ”¹ Kubectl Commands â€“ For gathering cluster state data directly
