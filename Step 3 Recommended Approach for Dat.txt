Step 3: Recommended Approach for Data Gathering

    Set Up Prometheus in Your Cluster:
        Install Prometheus using Helm:

    helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
    helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus

Expose Kubernetes Metrics Endpoint:

    Kubernetes exposes metrics at /metrics endpoint. Ensure that Prometheus is scraping this endpoint.

Gather Logs Using kubectl:
Sample commands to fetch useful data:

    kubectl top nodes      # Node-level metrics
    kubectl top pods       # Pod-level metrics
    kubectl logs <pod_name> --previous  # Previous pod logs (useful for crash diagnosis)

    Store Data for Model Training:
        Save logs and metrics in CSV or JSON format for easier preprocessing.

Step 4: Data Collection Strategy

    Collect time-series data for metric trends.
    Gather error labels (e.g., crash indicators, failed deployments) for model training.
    Include timestamps for tracking issue patterns.

how can i install prometheus
ChatGPT said:

To install Prometheus in your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:
Step 1: Install Helm (if not already installed)

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes and simplifies Prometheus installation.

    Install Helm using the following command:

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash

    Verify Helm Installation:

helm version

Step 2: Add the Prometheus Helm Chart Repository

Prometheus is available in the prometheus-community Helm repository.

helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update

Step 3: Install Prometheus Using Helm

This command deploys Prometheus with default configurations:

helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus

If you'd like to specify a namespace (recommended for better organization):

kubectl create namespace monitoring
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus --namespace monitoring

Step 4: Verify the Installation

    Check if the Prometheus pods are running:

kubectl get pods -n monitoring

    Confirm that the services are active:

kubectl get svc -n monitoring

Step 5: Access Prometheus Dashboard

To access the Prometheus UI locally:

    Port Forward the Prometheus Service:

kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-server 9090:80 -n monitoring

    Open your browser and visit:
    ðŸ‘‰ http://localhost:9090

Step 6: Configure Prometheus to Scrape Kubernetes Metrics

By default, Prometheus will scrape Kubernetes metrics. To confirm:

    Go to http://localhost:9090/targets
    Ensure that key endpoints like /metrics, kubelet, and apiserver are active.

Step 7: Test Prometheus Queries

Try these example queries in the Prometheus UI to explore your cluster data:

    CPU Usage by Node:

node_cpu_seconds_total

    Memory Usage by Pod:

container_memory_usage_bytes

    Failed Pods Count:

kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total
